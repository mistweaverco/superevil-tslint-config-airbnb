# `indent`

Enforce indentation with spaces.

## Rationale

Using only one of tabs or spaces for indentation leads to
more consistent editor behavior,
cleaner diffs in version control,
and easier programmatic manipulation.

## Implementation

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "indent": [true, "space"]
  }
}
```
